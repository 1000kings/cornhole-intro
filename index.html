                        <li>there are two game boards that are faced opposite eachother and spaced 27 feet apart from the front of one board to the front of the other</li>
                        <li>the game can be basically played as a singles match, ie one player against another, or a doubles match with two teams playing against eachother</li>

                                <li>in a singles match both players start from the same board, one player on each side of the board, and face the opposite board</li>
                                <li>in a doubles match one player from each team will position on each side of one board and the other pair of players will position on the opposite board on the same side of the board as their teammate</li>
                                <li>a player may position themselves along the side of the board any way they would like but they cannot be positioned with feet further than the front of the board or wider than 3 feet from the side of the board </li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>each singles player or doubles team plays the game with 4 bags, for a total of 8 bags in the game</li>

                                <li>the bags MUST be thrown underhand from one board to the opposite board; this is called pitching</li>
                                <li>the throwing of the bags is alternated: starting from the first board the first player will throw a bag and then the second player will throw a bag, alternating until each player has thrown 4 bags</li>

                                        <li>in a singles match the players will walk from one board to the other before throwing their 4 bags from the second board back to the first board</li>

                                <li>a bag that is on the board is worth 1 point</li>

                                <li>a bag that is off the board is worth 0 points</li>
                                <li>cornhole uses cancel scoring so you add up the points for the team with the most points and then subtract from that the points for the other player or team</li>

                                        <li>the most points possible is 12 if one team has 4 bags in the hole and the other team has 4 bags off the board</li>

                        Basic cornhole boards are 1/2" thick plywood panels which are 24" wide and 48" long.  The plywood platforms are elevated on side risers with legs at the back of the board.
                        The front of the board rests on the ground and the panel is elevated about 2 1/2" above ground level.  The back of the board sits on legs which stand 12" above the ground
                        so that the board platform is slanted up from front to back.  The center of the hole in the platform is situated 9" in from the back of the back of the board and 12" center from one side of the board.
                        The diameter of the hole is 6".

                        In a regulation game the shorter fronts of the boards face eachother with the holes to the back and are situated 27' apart.  There is an invisible rectangular "box" on both sides of each board that runs the length of the board (48") 
                        and 36" wide from the side of the board.  This invisible box is where the thrower may stand while pitching a bag.

                    As the name of the game implies, early cornhole bags were indeed filled with corn feed kernels.  The kernels were generally wrapped in cotton duck canvas on both sides.
                    A regulation cornhole bag is 6" square and approximately 16 ounces (1 lb).  As the game of cornhole has progressed from backyard fun to professionally televized events the bag
                    has also progressed.  Now most bags are filled with plastic pellets and feature different materials on each side of the back.  A basic elite level bag will have one side that is covered in 
                    cotton twill and an opposite side covered in a microfiber suede.  The twill side of the bag is considered a fast, slick or slide side.  If a bag lands on the board with this slick side down it will
                    generally slide up the board, and possibly off of it depending on how hard you throw.  The suede side of the cornhole bag is a sticky, or slow, slide of the bag.  If you land a bag on the board on this
                    side of the bag it has a better chance of sticking where it lands.  The bag moves much slower, if at all, though there is always a chance it could tumble.  Knowing these two sides of the bag well, and using
                    them appropriately can help a lot in the upcoming section on throwing a bag.
